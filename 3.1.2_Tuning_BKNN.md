# DRILL:
### Let's say we work at a credit card company and we're trying to figure out if people are going to pay their bills on time. We have everyone's purchases, split into four main categories: groceries, dining out, utilities, and entertainment. What are some ways you might use KNN to create this model? What aspects of KNN would be useful?

The initial assumption by using those numbers is that a change of spending pattern will be the only cause for defaulting : a sudden change of resource cannot be detected this way.

You will be defaulting on your credit card if you spend more than your resource can allow, so just looking at your total spending pattern will not precise enough, as you will need to understand the resource available.

By using different purchase categories, you can access an "image" of the resource available.

Typically, we can think of a scenario when a person subdenly makes a purchase that he can not cover with his resource and goes into default.

**groceries** and **utilities** are the long term spending : that would reflect the level of resource. (As they are long term commitment, if you did not have those spending reflect your available resources you will not be able to sustain then).

On the other hand, we could classify the **dining out** and **entertainment** has more susceptible for impulse purchasing, and more likely to put someone in a default situation.

The link will not be linear, for a given level of **groceries** and **utilities** you can potentially go into default very fast.

We could test doign the classification using all 4 dimensions or by adding together **groceries** and **utilities** on on side and **dining out** and **enternainment** on the other side.
